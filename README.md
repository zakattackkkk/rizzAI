# BrahVerse
BrahVerse is the AI version of InverseBrah. He takes a screenshot of any post you tag him in and shares his thoughts.  
Here’s what changed in the code. For details, please check the commits:

- **BrahVerse now uses the API from** [tweet2img](https://github.com/mhsattarian/tweet2img) **to generate screenshots of tweets.**
- **Improved** `packages/core/src/generation.ts` **to work with images** – [commit](https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/commit/b5ae9c036657eee4f0f2c6c12923d43069e3bd98).  
- **Edited the prompt to add a screenshot function and increased the delay time for checking interactions (from 10 to 30 minutes)** – [commit](https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/commit/5c25958e848ab8ff7e69c3108edbdd16edd9edf2).  
- **Customized the character using** [twitter-scraper-finetune](https://github.com/ai16z/twitter-scraper-finetune) **to scrape posts** – [commit](https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/commit/2ce6c97ce961acfb92a1ae33a1e5fbeea67d6d97).

# Getting Started

**Prerequisites (MUST):**

-   [Python 2.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
-   [Node.js 23.1+](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
-   [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

### Edit the .env file

-   Copy .env.example to .env and fill in the appropriate values
-   Edit the TWITTER environment variables to add your bot's username and password

### Edit the character file

-   Check out the file `src/core/defaultCharacter.ts` - you can modify this
-   You can also load characters with the `pnpm start --characters="path/to/your/character.json"` and run multiple bots at the same time.

After setting up the .env file and character file, you can start the bot with the following command:

```
pnpm i
pnpm start
```

# Customising Eliza

### Adding custom actions

To avoid git clashes in the core directory, we recommend adding custom actions to a `custom_actions` directory and then adding them to the `elizaConfig.yaml` file. See the `elizaConfig.example.yaml` file for an example.

## Running with different models

### Run with Llama

You can run Llama 70B or 405B models by setting the `XAI_MODEL` environment variable to `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-Turbo` or `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct`

### Run with Grok

You can run Grok models by setting the `XAI_MODEL` environment variable to `grok-beta`

### Run with OpenAI

You can run OpenAI models by setting the `XAI_MODEL` environment variable to `gpt-4o-mini` or `gpt-4o`

## Additional Requirements

You may need to install Sharp. If you see an error when starting up, try installing it with the following command:

```
pnpm install --include=optional sharp
```

# Environment Setup

You will need to add environment variables to your .env file to connect to various platforms:

```
# Required environment variables

# Local Inference Setup

### CUDA Setup

If you have an NVIDIA GPU, you can install CUDA to speed up local inference dramatically.

```
pnpm install
npx --no node-llama-cpp source download --gpu cuda
```

Make sure that you've installed the CUDA Toolkit, including cuDNN and cuBLAS.

### Running locally

Add XAI_MODEL and set it to one of the above options from [Run with
Llama](#run-with-llama) - you can leave X_SERVER_URL and XAI_API_KEY blank, it
downloads the model from huggingface and queries it locally

# Clients

## Discord Bot

For help with setting up your Discord Bot, check out here: https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html

# Development

## Testing

To run the test suite, you must got into each package:

```bash
pnpm test           # Run tests once
pnpm test:watch    # Run tests in watch mode
```

For database-specific tests:

```bash
pnpm test:sqlite   # Run tests with SQLite
pnpm test:sqljs    # Run tests with SQL.js
```

Tests are written using Jest and can be found in `src/**/*.test.ts` files. The test environment is configured to:

-   Load environment variables from `.env.test`
-   Use a 2-minute timeout for long-running tests
-   Support ESM modules
-   Run tests in sequence (--runInBand)

To create new tests, add a `.test.ts` file adjacent to the code you're testing.

## Docker

For development purposes, you can run the docker container with the following command:

```
pnpm docker
```

This will drop you into a shell inside the docker container where you can continue to configure the instance

and then you can start it with `pnpm start`
